                <p>With all recreational map apps there are particular features that are both good and bad to the user experience, 
                    our goal with this survey was to determine what map apps people like to use and the key feature that stand out 
                    to the users, such as tools, map formats, tracking and GPS. Along with their pain points about the apps as well. 
                    From this information we hope it will provide a direction to a map application that we will design.</p>

                <p>We chose to use an informal interview process to learn more about the apps that people used when outdoors.
                     There was a list of about 10 talking points that we followed however, in some cases it deviated from that
                      path and lead to other questions that weren't included in the list. It was more of a conversation style 
                      interview where the person would tell us about themselves and what they like to do while also talking and 
                      relating to them at the same time. It was more or less to get themselves thinking about what kinds of pains and 
                      gains that they encounter when using the apps that they most frequently use when they're outdoors.</p>

                <p>
                    From the Survey we discovered that most users prefer not to have a paywall. From the analysis of applications like 
                    Google Maps, Waze, and Apple Maps, the users like features that help with commuting times but also warn them of 
                    potential dangers of traffic (speed cams and police using radar guns). Google Maps also goes into detail on GPS 
                    locations you are traveling to. Applications such as Alltrails, OnX, Gaia GPS, and Strava have location recording 
                    features such as downloading maps to use offline and recording your trips outdoors regardless of the activity. OnX 
                    only conveys fishing access points while Fishbrain gives a more in-depth analysis of fishing locations, lures, etc.
                    Another issue with OnX is that the app has separate versions for different uses instead of making all features 
                    accessible in a single app. We will move in the direction of designing an application that allows you to use all 
                    their features regardless of activity in a single app to improve the User's experiences.

                    From developing the persona and business model the general target audience for the
                    application is the average outdoorsman. Using geolocation data and GPS features to help
                    inform users about areas they plan to use recreationally. Data for this service can be backed by
                    the US Forest Services and Fish and Wildlife agencies. Including a shopping/advertisement
                    feature to the application that is its own entity, meaning it does not conflict with the map
                    usability, and helps users shop for the activities they do separate from the maps.

                <p>
                    We decided that for our mind map we would throw ideas onto a whiteboards and pick from some of them. We
                    divided the board into four separate sections; Features, Content, Design Elements, and Navigation. The features being what
                    we wanted our app to bring to the users. Content was for what fills the apps. Design elements made us focus on what it should
                    look like. Finally, navigation, how we wanted the user move through our app.
                    Anything that we though of at the time would be classified and thrown up onto it. From that list we would then pick and choose
                    the items and ideas. Making sure to choose things that would bring us closer to a first prototype. We took a look at what we 
                    had on the board and put blue stars next to the things that should be important and might be our highest priority. This gave us a decent
                    number of ideas to work from and reference when making the low and high fidelity models.

                        From the mind-mapping step of the project, a consensus was made about stylistic elements such as typeface, icon choices, and color palettes. A bottom nav 
                        bar is best suited for the navigation within the application and the maps in the app should be aimed toward multiple activities to appeal to varying users. The trail review system will include 
                        photos and other general location information such as directions, distance, etc. This allows users to give reviews and collect location information from useful sites such as the US Forest Service. 
                        The “Store” page is still under discussion due to uncertainty about how it will be implemented.

                    The low fidelity wireframe was used to provide guidance on where pages of the application will
                    be placed for the high-fidelity prototype. We included some important features such as the
                    login and onboarding, and drafted the main pages and layouts that were explored but were
                    revised in the high-fidelity version.

                <p>
                    The High-fidelity wireframe came with many more elements that need to be made; icon sets
                    (simple and complex), color palettes and buttons were needed in the creation of this
                    wireframe. Which is why a style guide was utilized in its development. This provided the ability
                    to create a consistent design style of the wireframe allowing the pages within the app to feel
                    like they belong together. Compartmentalizing of features makes the app feel simplistic without
                    compromising the versatility of the app.

                <h2 class=" conclusion-head">Background: </h2>
                <p>For our research we wanted to test a couple of key values when it came to our app</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="survey">Whether they failed or not</li>
                    <li class="survey">Navigation Easiness</li>
                    <li class="survey">Adaptation Time</li>
                    <li class="survey">Total Clicks</li>
                    <li class="survey">Total Errors</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We felt that tracking these values would lead to a more accurate
                    representation of how our app performs for new user. The values
                    that we wanted to focus on were easiness, adaptation time, clicks,
                    and errors.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The testing was done on and off Montana State University campus between Nov 28-30 2023.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There were a couple tools that we utilized during the testing process.
                    We used a python program that the surveyor would use to input information
                    that they collected. That collected data would then be submitted to a file
                    called data.csv. We also needed a way for the user to interact with out app.
                    We used our wireframe that was already built in Adobe XD. Which allowed us to
                    start the file on a mobile device and interact with it like it was an app. We also
                    used a click counter and a timer for measuring some of the other data that we were
                    collecting. Python was utilized again to read the data in the csv file and
                    generate graphs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Nathan Mosher was responsible for the data collection and Logan Trudel was responsible
                    for the processing of the data collected. Both parties were involved in the designing
                    of the testing process.

                <p>Testing five people allowed us to get a decent amount of initial data.
                    These graphs represent the raw data collected from each person. Illustrating
                    the differences between five different users.

                <br>
                <p>Figure one represents the easiness rating that each user gave.
                    After the test concluded they were asked how easy the app was to navigate
                    from a scale of 1-10.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Figure two represents the time that it took for each user to feel that they could
                    comfortably navigate though the app.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Figure three represents the total amount of clicks that it took for the user to
                    complete all the assigned tasks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Figure four represents the total amount of errors that each user encountered
                    when completing their assigned tasks.

            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>These images represent the same information mentioned up above. However, the mean values of the data as well
                    as the standard deviations are now displayed. We can see that on average 7 was the easiness score, 140 seconds was the time, 51 was the amount of clicks,
                    and 4.5 was the value for total errors. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  We found that there might be a correlation between some of the data collected, however, more statistical tests must be done before that conclusion is settled.
                  We hypothesize that users what averaged a higher amount of clicks and errors might rate the app as more difficult, compared with users that averaged lower values.
                  Minimizing the amount of steps and clicks that it takes to navigate though the pages and setting should be one the higher priority changes the we follow through with.
                  We also found that here is a large deviation of times and errors when compared to the mean values of those categories. Some users ran into significantly less errors compared
                  to others, which may have influenced their difficulty score. The same conclusion could possibly be reached with adaptation time as well. Where the longer the user used to get
                  used to the app the more difficult they might deem it. With these hypothesis in mind we might be able to drastically improve the user experience of our app.

                <br>
                <p>
                    We received a couple comments from the users that we tested. Of those comments here are some of the notable ones.
                    The search and map pages could use more interactive features. The search bar needs to have more linked content.
                    Finally, the map could be zoomed out more for easier viewing. We believe that these comments were the most impactful
                    when if came to the design and interaction with our app. The changes that would be coupled with these comments are
                    not very hard to obtain. Only some simple tweaks are needed for the app to be more interactive and have a better user
                    experience.

                        From the Data collected in the survey easiness scored an average of 7 meaning we are on the right track when it comes to building an easy to navigate application. 
                        The average time for the users to become familiar with the application was just over 2 minutes meaning the app has a relatively fast learning process,
                         The average amount of clicks for the users exploring the entire app is over 50 clicks, and the average amount Errors being around 5, meaning there is 
                         improvements to be made with some navigation features such as the map and search pages.

                    <p>From the comments that were collected post-interview, The recommended improvements were targeted towards the map and search features, with the user wanting to see more features involved in those parts of the app.
                         Suggestions from other fellow graphical UX designers were that the search page and Deals page could use a rework on their layout with buttons and content.
                          The icons on the deals page should redesigned to represent the style guide more closely.</p>
